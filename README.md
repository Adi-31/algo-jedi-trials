# Algorithmic Jedi Trials

Algorithmic Jedi Trials is a project designed to provide developers with a platform to test and refine their algorithmic skills. Inspired by the trials of Jedi Padawans in the Star Wars universe, participants will face a series of challenges ranging from fundamental logic puzzles to advanced computational problems. Our goal is to create an engaging environment where developers can enhance their problem-solving abilities and become masters of code. Join us on this journey and may the algorithms guide your path to mastery!
